\- My Japanese translation of Carmilla(1872) by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu<br><br>

This project is my Japanese translation of<br>
Carmilla(1872) by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu(1814-1873).<br>
References:<br>
- a copy of the original text<br>
(CARMILLA, JOSEPH LE FANU, ISBN 9781548816209, sourced from https://gutenberg.org).<br>
I also write this original text at the top of the each line.
- H. SAITO, 1898,1899, *PRACTICAL ENGLISH GRAMMAR*, VOL.I--IV, TŌKYŌ: KŌBUNSHA, PUBLISHERS.<br>
H.SAITO(1866-1929)'s masterpiece written in English.<br>
I employ this for the grammatical study of the original text,<br>
and sometimes translate SAITO's explanations into Japanese,<br>
and use them in my memorandum added at the bottom of the each file.
- KENKYUSHA, 1960, *KENKYUSHA'S NEW ENGLISH-JAPANESE DICTIONARY*.<br>
In my grammatical memoranda, I sometimes quote example sentences from this dictionary.<br><br>

Using these references, I read the original text carefully,<br>
and make all the efforts possible to leave the original meaning as it is.<br>
